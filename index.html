    <h1>Face it Alone</h1>
    <h2><i>by Queen</i></h2>
    <p>
      When something so near and dear to life,<br />
      Explodes inside,<br />
      You feel your soul,<br />
      Is set on fire.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When something so deep and so far and wide,<br />
      Falls down beside,<br />
      Your cries can be heard,<br />
      So loud and clear.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Your life is your own,<br />
      You're in charge of yourself,<br />
      Master of your home,<br />
      In the end,<br />
      In the end,<br />
      You have to face it all alone.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When something so dear to your life,<br />
      Explodes inside,<br />
      You feel your soul,<br />
      Is burned alive (burned alive).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When something so deep and so far and wide,<br />
      Falls down beside,<br />
      Your cries can be heard,<br />
      So loud and clear.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Your life is your own,<br />
      You're in charge of yourself,<br />
      Master of your home,<br />
      In the end,<br />
      In the end,<br />
      You have to face it alone.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When the moon has lost its glow,<br />
      When the moon has lost its glow,<br />
      When the moon has, when the moon has lost its glow,<br />
      When the moon, when the moon has lost its glow, <br />You have to face it
      all alone
    </p>
